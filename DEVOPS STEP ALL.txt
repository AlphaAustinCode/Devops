Q14. Execute basic command in git
Step 1: Check Git Version 
      → git --version
      ✅ Shows if Git is installed and its version.
Step 2: Configure Git (first time only)
      → git config --global user.name "Your Name"
      → git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
      ✅ Sets your name and email for commits.

      ✅ Saves the staged changes to local repository.
Step 7: View Commit History
      → git log
      ✅ Displays a list of commits with author, date, and message.
Step 8: Connect to a Remote Repository (e.g., GitHub)
      → git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
      ✅ Links your local repo to a remote one.
Step 9: Push Changes to Remote Repository
      → git push -u origin main
      ✅ Uploads commits to GitHub (branch = main).
Step 10: Pull Latest Changes from Remote
       → git pull origin main
       ✅ Downloads and merges changes from GitHub.
Step 11: Clone an Existing Repository
       → git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
       ✅ Makes a local copy of a remote repository.
Step 12: Create and Switch Branches
       → git branch new-feature
       → git checkout new-feature
       ✅ Creates and moves to a new branch.
Step 13: Merge Branch
       → git checkout main
       → git merge new-feature
       ✅ Combines changes from another branch into main.
Step 14: Remove a File
       → git rm filename.txt
       → git commit -m "Removed filename.txt"
Step 15: View Remote Repositories
       → git remote -v
       ✅ Lists the linked remote repositories.
