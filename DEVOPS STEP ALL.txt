Q14) Execute basic command in git
Step 1: Check Git Version 
      → git --version
      ✅ Shows if Git is installed and its version.
Step 2: Configure Git (first time only)
      → git config --global user.name "Your Name"
      → git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
      ✅ Sets your name and email for commits.
Step 3: Initialize a Repository
      → git init
      ✅ Creates a new Git repository in your current folder.
Step 4: Check Repository Status
      → git status
      ✅ Shows which files are modified, staged, or untracked.
Step 5: Add Files to Staging Area
      → git add filename.txt or add all files → git add .
      ✅ Prepares files for commit.
Step 6: Commit Changes
      → git commit -m "Added new feature"
      ✅ Saves the staged changes to local repository.
Step 7: View Commit History
      → git log
      ✅ Displays a list of commits with author, date, and message.
Step 8: Connect to a Remote Repository (e.g., GitHub)
      → git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
      ✅ Links your local repo to a remote one.
Step 9: Push Changes to Remote Repository
      → git push -u origin main
      ✅ Uploads commits to GitHub (branch = main).
Step 10: Pull Latest Changes from Remote
       → git pull origin main
       ✅ Downloads and merges changes from GitHub.
Step 11: Clone an Existing Repository
       → git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
       ✅ Makes a local copy of a remote repository.
Step 12: Create and Switch Branches
       → git branch new-feature
       → git checkout new-feature
       ✅ Creates and moves to a new branch.
Step 13: Merge Branch
       → git checkout main
       → git merge new-feature
       ✅ Combines changes from another branch into main.
Step 14: Remove a File
       → git rm filename.txt
       → git commit -m "Removed filename.txt"
Step 15: View Remote Repositories
       → git remote -v
       ✅ Lists the linked remote repositories.

17) Build a Docker image from the Docker file, run a Docker container using the built image.0
Step 1: Create a Project Folder
       → mkdir docker-demo
       → cd docker-demo
Step 2: Create a Simple Application
       Example: A basic “Hello World” Python app
       Create a file named app.py:
       print("Hello, World! from Docker Container")

Step 3: Create a Dockerfile
       → Create a file named Dockerfile (no extension)
      # Use an official Python base image
      FROM python:3.9-slim
      # Set working directory inside container
      WORKDIR /app
      # Copy application files into container
      COPY . /app
      # Command to run the app
      CMD ["python", "app.py"]
✅ Explanation:
FROM → base image to start with
WORKDIR → sets default directory
COPY → copies project files
CMD → command to execute when container starts

Step 4: Build the Docker Image
       Run this command in the same directory as your Dockerfile:
       → sudo docker build -t hello-docker .
      ✅ -t is used to tag (name) the image.

Step 5: Verify Image Creation
       → sudo docker images
  ✅ You’ll see something like:

REPOSITORY       TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
hello-docker     latest    a1b2c3d4e5f6   2 minutes ago   125MB

6️⃣ Run the Docker Container
sudo docker run hello-docker


✅ Output:

Hello, World! from Docker Container

7️⃣ (Optional) Run in Interactive Mode
sudo docker run -it hello-docker /bin/bash


✅ Opens a terminal inside the running container.

8️⃣ Stop & Remove Container (Optional)
sudo docker ps -a           # list all containers
sudo docker stop <container_id>
sudo docker rm <container_id>
